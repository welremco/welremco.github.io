I am a M.Sc. student in Artificial Intelligence at [Maastricht University](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/education/partner-program-master/artificial-intelligence). Before starting my master's, I obtained my BSc in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence
at the same university. During my bachelor's, I worked on applied research in Symbolic Regression combined with Genetic Algorithms on pension fund administration
data as an AI research intern at [APG](https://apg.nl/en/).

Currently, I am a Data Science research intern at [ASML](https://www.asml.com/en), where I focus on the interpretability-fitness trade-off in model disovery using genetic programming.
My academic interests lie in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, where my current focus lies on model discovery. Further details can be found on the projects page, where you can find reports of previous projects I worked on.

In my personal time, I enjoy playing piano, guitar, and bass guitar.
